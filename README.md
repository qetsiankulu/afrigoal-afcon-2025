### üéì What I Learned
- Implementing **keyboard dismissal with drag gestures** in SwiftUI using `.simultaneousGesture` to preserve scroll behavior.
- Managing **state across views** using `@StateObject` and `@Binding` effectively.
- Learned how to refactor an existing component by integrating and customizing a component from an open-source SwiftUI library created by [Exyte](https://github.com/exyte).
- Structuring **scrollable content with animations** for a polished onboarding feel.
- Fine-tuning layout with `GeometryReader`, `ZStack`, and `Spacer()` to handle different screen sizes and navigation stacks.
- Building a secure **Python FastAPI backend** to safely proxy and manage API key/secret for LiveScoreAPI, enabling secure data fetching from the iOS app without exposing sensitive credentials.
- Learned how to deploy a FastAPI backend to **Render**, securely manage API keys with environment variables, and connect the iOS app to a live backend so both simulator and physical devices can fetch data remotely
- Applying the **MVVM pattern** by using a ViewModel to bridge the View and Model layers, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and making SwiftUI code more scalable and testable
